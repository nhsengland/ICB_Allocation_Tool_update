    Processes and aggregates data for all datasets across multiple years.

    provided aggregation functions and queries. The aggregated and indexed data is then stored back in

        An object that contains the session state, including a list of places and corresponding 
        geographical and ICB information for each place.
        
    aggregations : dict
        A dictionary specifying the aggregation functions to apply to the data. The keys are column names

    index_numerator : str
        The column name to use as the numerator for index calculations.

    index_names : list
