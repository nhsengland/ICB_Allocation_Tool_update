        This tool was built to provide insight into smaller area (place) level variation underlying Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) resource allocation. The
        intention of the tool is to provide insights that may help inform ICB-level allocations and contribute to evidence-based resource decisions.
        \n\nThe tool presents <b>weighted populations</b> and <b>need indices</b> calculated by the <b>allocation model</b> for each of its <b>service components</b>, 
        by user-created <b>place</b>
        \n\n<b>Weighted populations</b> are GP practice populations (projected forward) multiplied by the need weight for a specific service as produced by the allocation 
        model.

        Where <i>WP</i> is the weighted population for a given need, <i>GP</i> is the GP practice population, <i>i</i> is the ICB, and <i>p</i> is the Defined Place.
        \n\nThe need indices for these places are relative to their ICB, meaning that a value of 1.00 for a component in a defined place equals the level of need of 
        the ICB as a whole. If a place has a need index with a value below 1.00, it has a lower level of need compared to the ICB. A value above 1.00 means there is 
        a higher need in that place compared to the ICB.

        exception of health inequalities<sup>1</sup>, this historic need together with population projections is then used to predict need for specific healthcare services

The data used in the analysis represents millions of patients, their use of healthcare services, the cost of that use, as well as their demographics.
