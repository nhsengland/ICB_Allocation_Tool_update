        \n\n 1.  Practice moves connected to practice mergers were included.
        \n\n 2.  The “annual” data included only eleven months of practice moves.
        \n\n This will have particularly impacted on practices that have been through voluntary mergers and student practice which have high numbers of registrations in September.
        \n\n These errors have now been corrected. The weighted populations in the place-based tool have been updated to reflect these changes as there were a small number of practices that are substantially affected. ICB allocations will not be updated as the recalculation has a small impact at ICB level and this is also mitigated by convergence policy. Therefore, the practice weighted populations and need indices in the place based tool will be different to those published in workbook K (primary medical care 2025-26)."""
